# Terminology

**Schools and school corporations** are handled separately in this application, but treated similarly, as either can be 
ranked. School corporations (a term used in Indiana) are referred to as school _districts_ internally, in order to use 
terminology that applies to administrative units in any state.

Together, schools and school corporations may be collectively referred to as "locations" when that usage would not be 
confused with geographic information such as a school's city, county, and address. Elsewhere, schools and school 
corporations may be collectively referred to as "subjects" of a ranking task. 

The word **context** is used to refer to whether schools or school corporations are currently relevant. For example, if a 
user fills out a form to rank a collection of schools or school corporations, the code will need to determine from the 
user's input which of those two is the _context_ of the current ranking task.
